# DropInMultiplayer
The drop in multiplayer mod for Risk of Rain 2, now updated (hopefully) to work with Alloyed Collective!
This mod allows the host to have players join mid-game, and automatically gives them items to help them catch up!

If you have any bug reports, ping me on the modding discord (@niwith on https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd), or feel free to private message me.
**If you are reporting a bug, please include a copy of your logs, type "!log" in the modding dicsord server for instructions on how to grab your logs.**

Credit to https://thunderstore.io/package/SushiDev/DropinMultiplayer/ for originally creating this mod.

## Instructions
### How to Join Existing Game (Steam)
1. Go to steam friends list
2. Click the little arrow next to your friend's name
3. Click the "Join Friend" button
4. You will now be loaded into spectator mode in Risk of Rain 2
5. Press enter to open chat and type your join_as command (with the '/' at the start), e.g.
    * /join_as Commando
    * /join_as Huntress
    * /join_as Captain

### How to Join Existing Game (Epic)
If anyone has used this mod on epic and can confirm the steps to join an ongoing game through epic, please let me know. 
I have not been able to test this myself.

### More Chat Commands Examples
These commands should be sent into the game chat, can also be used in console with dim_ added to the start of the command name, e.g. dim_join_as
* **/join_as Commando** - Spawns you in as commando.
* **/join_as Huntress niwith** - Spawns niwith in as Huntress, replace niwith with whoever you'd like to spawn as huntress/whatever in the names list. 
* **/list_survivors** - Lists availible survivors for the join_as command
* **/list_bodies** - Lists availible bodies for join_as command (bodies will only work for join_as if "AllowJoinAsAnyBody" is enabled in config settings)

If you get stuck, try the help command: 
* **/help** - Lists availible commands
* **/help join_as** - Prints the help text for join_as command

### Important Configs to Check
* AllowRespawn (default = enabled): When enabled, dead players will be able to use the join_as command and it will cause them to respawn. I have enabled by default, because enabling this means that if an error does occur with rejoining existing players they can still use the join_as command to spawn in.
* GiveRejoiningPlayersCatchUpItems (default = enabled): When enabled, if an existing player leaves and rejoins the game they will be given items to catch up as well, however this does introduce an exploit if one player runs around the map collecting all items, then the other players all leave and rejoin to get the catchup items. 
* AllowJoinAsHiddenSurvivors (default = enabled): When enabled, allows players to join as characters marked by developers as "hidden", e.g. , heretic
* AllowJoinAsAllBodies (default = disabled): When enabled, the join_as command will check the BodyCatelog in addition to survivor list, which lets players join as basically anything (e.g. a beetle). 
* JoinAsRandomByDefault (default = disabled): When enabled, players will spawn as a random character as they spawn in. After this they will still be able to switch character with join_as.

Note that in config options "enabled" is true and "disabled" is false.
Also if updating from an old version of the mod, your old config may hang around, which may have different configraution, and some old no longer used config options. My suggestion is delete your old config file to avoid confusion.

### Known Issues
* **DO NOT JOIN AS A DLC CHARACTER IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE DLC** doing so may cause the game to freeze or crash
* Ongoing game sometimes cannot be joined through steam - Unfortunetly I believe this is an issue outside of the scope of this mod, if anyone has more understanding of how steam networking works in RoR2 and what would fix the issue please let me know (or submit a pull request)
* [WIP] Switching from Operator doesn't remove the drones that come as part of the character, working on a fix for this one just needs more work

# Changelog
### 4.2.1
* Long time no update, fixed a couple bugs with a few merged pull requests

    * Thank you to @viliger2 (https://github.com/viliger2) for pull request "Fix for join_as restoring original body on stage change" (https://github.com/niwith/DropInMultiplayer/pull/25)
    * Thank you to @Mistaf (https://github.com/Mistaf) for pull request "Fix typo in catch up items configuration#24" https://github.com/niwith/DropInMultiplayer/pull/24

### 4.2.0
* Updated to be compatible with Alloyed Collective
    * Switched to using new versions of add, remove and count items that only interact with permenant items
    * Fixed issue that would allow players to respawn using /join if they were remote operating a drone

### 4.1.0
* Merged pull request "Config option for Heretic Items, Config option to prevent Captain Scrap Abuse" (https://github.com/niwith/DropInMultiplayer/pull/21)
    * Fixes to prevent edge case where infinite red scrap  could be obtained by getting new Microbots when spawning as Captain (with config to revet this behaviour, default is to prevent scrap abuse)
    * Adds config to toggle if using join as heritic should give the 4 requried items (default is to give the 4 items)
    * Big thank you to @Moffein (https://github.com/Moffein) for the PR
* Fix for issue "Missing return statement; causes NullReferenceException" (https://github.com/niwith/DropInMultiplayer/issues/18) 

### 4.0.0
* Updated referenced DLLs so that the build is compatible with the updates made in the main game update of Seekers of the Storm
* Have not tested with the DLC itself, any of the new characters or items. I assume these will work without issue, but please let me know if that's not the case
* This fix worked with my local testing, however as always please report the issue and **include your logs files**

### 3.0.0
* Been a while since an update, this one updates the referenced DLLs
* If doing this hasn't fixed your issue, please report the issue and include your logs files

### 2.0.1
* Fixed debug mode enabled, which interfered with some networking and could have been causing reported issues

### 2.0.0
* Rewrote the mod almost from scratch
* Fixed bug preventing rejoining player (who had not died in the current stage) from automatically spawning in
* Fixed bug preventing non-english languages from selecting characters, checkout the list_survivors command, either the internal name on the left, e.g. VoidSurvivor or the name in brackets, e.g. (MUL-T) should now work
* Change a lot of the config options, you may want to regenerate your file to avoid issues
* Changed the way catch up items work, now it the gives you random items across all tiers, with lower change at higher tier items, rather than the exact average that other players have for each tier
    * This now aligns with code the RoR2 devs have for giving a player random items and is based on the drop chance they had in configured in their code
* Added ability to join as any registered body prefab, gated behind the "AllowJoinAsAnyBody" config option
* Added chat commands for listing survivors and listing bodies
* Added better descriptions for config options
* Added a lot more logging, which should help track down bugs faster in future
* Removed drop item blacklist, the way this system was set up was causing some issues, all items for drops are now pulled directly from the run's drop table, e.g. Run.instance.availableTier1DropList, so there shouldn't need to be any item blacklisting
    * If for some reason I am incorrect and the black list was necessary somewhere let me know, it won't be a high priority to add back 
* Hopefully fixed compatiblity with other mods that muck around with the players bodyPrefab, since I now call to set the players body preference so when another mod switches the player back to their selected body preference it won't be wierd (hopefully)
* I believe fixed issue with joining as modded characters, tested with Enforcer (which was reported as broken) and didn't have an issue, although I''m not sure what I did which fixed this
* If you made a feature request, and it is not listed on this board (https://github.com/niwith/DropInMultiplayer/projects/1) in todo already, it is possible I forgot about your thing so feel free to message me and I'll add to the todo
* If there is a bug you reported, and it is not fixed in this patch, then I probably forgot about it so please let me know 
* Might be some other stuff I forgot
